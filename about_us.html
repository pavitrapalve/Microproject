    <h1>Mamma Spice's Story</h1>
    <img src="spice kitchen.webp" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" width="800" height="700" alt="stiching">
    <p>We have become pretty famous for our signature Indian Spice Tin, and right at the beginning of our journey Mum decided to sew recycled silk saris to ‘dress’ the tins beautifully.</p>

<p>To this day, our customers tell us that this detail makes our products super special. Mum now employs a team of seamstresses who help her to make the saris, and she’s always conscious of hiring people who are socially disadvantaged and who might struggle to find work elsewhere. This is just one of the ways she is truly an extraordinary human.</p> 

<p>Shashi says: "Food has always been at the heart of my life, serving as a means of expressing love to my family. I can't recall a single day of my adult life when I didn't cook something. My home has always been open to extended family members seeking to build a life in the UK, and the tradition was to gather around our kitchen table upon their arrival, sharing a hearty meal while discussing their hopes and dreams for the future. This dining table has been the starting point for numerous new beginnings, made even more special with a lovingly prepared family meal. It is the very same dining table where my son, Sanjay, and I conceived the idea for our family business, Spice Kitchen, in 2012. Naturally, any business venture we pursued was bound to involve spices. Now, in my seventh decade, I am delighted to share my passion for food with people from all corners of the world."</p>


    <h1>Starting Out</h1>
    <img src="spices.webp"style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" width="800" height="700" alt="starting out">
<p>When we were just starting out, I started small and pitched up at Altrincham Market with a makeshift sign and some wooden tables, selling tins and serving mulled wine, often in freezing conditions. Spice Kitchen has come so far since those days!<p> 

<p>We began to push further afield, attending the BBC Good Food Show and were approached to appear on the Hairy Bikers in 2017. Me and mum were asked to cook for the CEO of eBay and his team, and from there, things just mushroomed! We won several industry awards, including the prestigious Gift of the Year and the Great Taste Awards for our family Garam Masala recipe.</p> 


    <h1>Growing</h1>
    <img src="granding.webp" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" width="800" height="700" alt="growing">
<p>Then, as things started to really take off, we found our first little manufacturing space in Cheshire. We expanded our product range from our flagship Indian Spice Tin into Middle Eastern, World, International Chilli, Moroccan and Gin Botanicals collections. I even created a special range of spice blends for babies and children called Baby Spice Kitchen after seeing how well my young daughter Zara responded to new flavours.<p>
<p>We were truly fortunate to continue to be open throughout the pandemic, and as people started to cook more from home, lots of new customers found us as they were keen to experiment with spices. Because Spice Kitchen has always been about sharing mine and mum’s love of cooking at home, it was the perfect chance for us to develop loads of recipes to help inspire people to cook amazing meals while in lockdown.</p> 


    <h1>The Present Day</h1>
<img src="the present day.webp" style="display:block; margin:0 auto;" width="800" height="700" alt="the present day">

<p>In 2023, we released our first cookery book, Spice Kitchen. We’re available across hundreds of retailers, including John Lewis, Selfridges, Notcutts and Oxfam and internationally too…not to mention 100’s of independent farm shops, delis & garden centres across the UK.</p>

<p>In 2021, we moved to a larger office and warehouse space in Liverpool, and this has really completed the dream as we can support so many more of our lovely customers. I’m doing what I can to make a difference in the world in the small ways I can, essentially trying to follow in mum’s footsteps… All of the staff who work with us receive a fair/living wage, and I’m also super passionate about helping young people, and we’ve been giving work opportunities to those struggling to find work via the government’s Kickstart Programme.</p> 

<p>During all of this, the team started to grow bigger and stronger, and without them, I know none of this could have been possible.</p>

<p>I’m always so humbled by how much people love what we do… and every day when I open the doors, I am grateful that I get to do something so amazing. It’s literally a dream come true.</p>
